# Rain_Prediction_in_Australia
## To predict whether there will be rain the following day.
### Rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology , clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. Alternatively, download the data from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/

### The following algorithms are use to build the models:
#### 1. Linear Regression
#### 2. KNN
#### 3. Decision Trees
#### 4. Logistic Regression
#### 5. SVM

### The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics, when these are applicable:
#### 1. Accuracy Score
#### 2. Jaccard Index
#### 3. F1-Score
#### 4. LogLoss
#### 5. Mean Absolute Error
#### 6. Mean Squared Error
#### 7. R2-Score
